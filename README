Rakudo Star+

Please note: while it might be usable, it is not currently recommended
to use it as of now.

Rakudo Star+ as an experimental alternative to Rakudo Star,
able to install MoarVM, NQP, Rakudo and a few modules (the same
as Rakudo Star), fetching them through git or HTTP, with optional
GPG verification, and parallel installation of modules, written
in Perl.

It suffers from a few issues, the main one being that the parallel
installation of modules might try to compile one before its dependency,
leading to (unproblematic) errors.

You can try it on your computer (or in a Docker container, for testing purposes):
	git clone https://github.com/demostanis/rakudostar+
	cpanm --force Parallel::ForkManager \
		LWP::UserAgent LWP::Protocol::https \
		Archive::Tar Getopt::Std GnuPG::Interface \
		Time::Duration IPC::Run
	./r\*+.pl -h
-- OR --
	docker build -t rakudostarplus .
	docker run -it rakudostarplus

A PKGBUILD is expected to be created soon.
